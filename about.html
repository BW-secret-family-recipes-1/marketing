      <div class= "About">
        <p>At Secret Family Recipes, we believe in cherishing memories that were shared around a kitchen table because of a sacred recipe. Food brings people together and what better way to bring people together than sharing the recipes that brought your family and friends together. Secret Family Recipes allows you to upload your favorite recipes and share them with the world. You can even upload the recipe card written in that beautiful cursive grandma used. Have an idea to improve the recipe but don't want to lose the original? No problem! You can add to the recipes without changing the original. </p>

        <p>Secret Family Recipes was created by a team of students at Lambda School. We are proud of the product we have created and hope you enjoy using it as much as we did making it.  </p>
